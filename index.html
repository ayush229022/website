<pre><b><i>Spiderman is amazing,
    He swings from building to building,
    Never hesitating,
    He’s always there to save the day,
    No matter what.
    He’s a hero,
    For everyone to admire,
    And his powers are astounding,
    He’s the best there is.
    Peter Parker was bitten by a spider,
    and gained unusual powers.
    He became Spiderman, a hero who fights for justice.
    He uses his powers to help those in need,
    and always does the right thing.
    Spiderman is a symbol of hope,
    and he inspires others to do good.</i></b></pre>
